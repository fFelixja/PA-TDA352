# Programming Assignment - TDA352

__Cryptlib__: a library that provides a number of mathematical functions commonly used in cryptography, such as Euler's Phi Function (Totient), the Extended Euclidean Algorithm

__Fiat-Shamir-Attack__:  Eavesdropped on a number of Fiat-Shamir protocol runs. Found that the same nonce was used twice! Due to the special soundness property the secret key used in the protocol can be retrieved. :)

__CBC-Attack__: Intercepted a message that was encrypted using cypher-block chaining and decrypt it under the premise: knowing the plain-text value of the first block. ^^
